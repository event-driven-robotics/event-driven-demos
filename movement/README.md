# Move head

The `move_examples.sh` script can be used to do simple movements with the head and the arms.

## Prepare

After normally starting the motors, make sure that the `ctpService` for: `left-arm, right-arm` and `head` is running. You can use the yarp manager and use the application `iCubDemoFunnyEventDriven` to start the modules.

## How to run

To use the script simply run: `./move_examples.sh <command>`. For example: `./move_examples.sh look_left`. Look at the script for the list of commands avalilable.
